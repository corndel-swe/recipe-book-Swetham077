        <h1>Calamares a la Romana (Spanish Fried Calamari)</h1>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds squid, preferably cleaned</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cups Spanish olive oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, or more</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 lemon, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wherever and however you buy the squid, they need to be cleaned before cooking. The spines, ink sacks, and heads should be discarded. If you are cleaning the squid yourself, donâ€™t throw away the tentacles because those are good to eat, too.</li>
            <li>Once the squid are cleaned, dry them thoroughly. Cut the squid bodies into rings.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 inch of olive oil into a large open frying pan and put on high heat for frying, but be careful that the oil does not smoke.</li>
            <li>Put the flour and a bit of salt into a large plastic bag. Place a few pieces of squid into the bag and shake to cover with flour. Remove the rings one at a time with your hands and carefully place in the hot oil.</li>
            <li>Continue to cover pieces in flour and add to the frying pan. Do not crowd the pan, leaving enough room in the pan to turn over squid rings if necessary.</li>
            <li>Fry until the rings turn golden. When done, remove the squid rings from pan and allow to drain on a paper towel. Serve hot with lemon.</li>
        </ol>
