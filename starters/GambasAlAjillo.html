        <li>1 1/2 pounds shelled and deveined large shrimp, tails intact</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small dried hot red chile, seeded and crumbled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry, such as manzanilla</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss the shrimp with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a 9- to 10-inch enameled cast-iron skillet, combine the garlic and olive oil and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is very fragrant and just starts to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the chile and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook over moderately low heat, stirring and turning the shrimp occasionally, until barely pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley, sherry, lemon zest and a generous pinch of salt. Remove from the heat and let stand until the shrimp are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve in the skillet, passing crusty bread at the table.</li>
